# Project Repository

## Product Vision Statement:

### MVP
* The MVP of EventEdge, needs to include a way for users to register and login. It also needs to include a list of group chats. Users should also be able to create a new group chat. In any given group chat they should be able to add members. A user should algo have the ability to leave a group. A user should be able to chat to any specified group chat. A user should also have a page where they can see a list of the events they are a part of. Users should be able to create events for any group chat while on that group chat’s page, and the event will appear on each of the group chat members’ individual event pages.
