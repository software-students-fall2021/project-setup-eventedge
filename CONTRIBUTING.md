# Contributing to EventEdge

## Team Norms

### Team Values:
* When facing any roadblocks ask for help ASAP to meet deadlines
* When there is a conflict we will vote among the 5 of us
  * If a group member is not delivering obligations, we will give them warnings and then notify the stakeholders
* Respond to directed messages within a day

### Sprint Cadence
* Sprints are 1-2 weeks

### Daily Standup
* 3 standups of 15 mins: Tuesday evening, Thursday evening, Saturday morning

### Coding standards
* Linter and code formatter: Eslint and prettier
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the main branch of code.

## Git Workflow
* Decentralized

## A detailed description of the rules of contributing / PULL REQUEST guidelines
* Always make a PR for a feature
* Never merge PR before at least one review has been made
* With each PR, please include a description of the changes:
  * Which task/spike does the PR refer to (issue number)
  * What changes have been made
* Review other open PRs if they are not yet reviewed
* Commit titles should be of the following format: `“Add feature”`, `“Change something”` and etc.
* Make sure you format the files before merging a PR by running `npm run format` and `npm run lint`
